[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findboost.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "boost", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "boost" with any of
  the following names:

    boostConfig.cmake
    boost-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "boost" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "boost_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "boost"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
