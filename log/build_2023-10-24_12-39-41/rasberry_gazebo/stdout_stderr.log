[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgazebo_ros_pkgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "gazebo_ros_pkgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gazebo_ros_pkgs"
  with any of the following names:

    gazebo_ros_pkgsConfig.cmake
    gazebo_ros_pkgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gazebo_ros_pkgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "gazebo_ros_pkgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "gazebo_ros_pkgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
