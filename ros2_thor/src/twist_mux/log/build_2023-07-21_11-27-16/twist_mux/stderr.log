[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddiagnostics.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "diagnostics", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "diagnostics" with
  any of the following names:

    diagnosticsConfig.cmake
    diagnostics-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "diagnostics" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "diagnostics_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "diagnostics" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
